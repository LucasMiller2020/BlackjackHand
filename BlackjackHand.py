Instructions:

Implement the methods defined in the BlackjackHand class defined below in a file named BlackjackHand.py and also
write unit test code to fully test the BlackjackHand class in a file named test_BlackjackHand.py. You may change the
instance variables if you prefer a different way of implementing the methods, but the API for each method (name,
parameters and their types, and the return value) must match the API in the provided declaration. â€¢ submit your
BlackjackHand.py and test_BlackjackHand.py files on iLearn before the due date
